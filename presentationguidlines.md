## Presentation Time

### What to Present

For presentations we want to show off our webpages and their functionality!

- Present the webpage as if you were presenting it to me as a user, telling me
what the webpage is about and what I can get from the webpage. Think: Why should we visit your webpage?

- Show off a part of the webpage you're particularly proud of
- Mention a part of the code that took a while to get working
- Everyone needs to participate in the presentation letting us know what you contributed to the group
- Should be no longer than 5 minutes

### How to Present
One member of the team will share their screen while they and other members present
the webpage and code to the class

Good job and good luck!
