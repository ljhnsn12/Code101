## Presentation Time

### What to Present

For presentations we want to show off our webpages and their functionality!

- Present the webpage as if you were presenting it to me as a user, telling me
what the webpage is about and what I can get from the webpage.

- Show off a part of the webpage you're particularly proud of
- Mention a part of the code that took a while to get working
- Not everyone needs to speak during the presentaiton, but everyone should contribute  to presentatin prep
- Should be no longer than 5 minutes

### How to Present
One member of the team will share their screen while they and other members present
the webpage and optionally the html, css code to the class

Good luck
