## Multiple webpages
Every group will create their own webpages using the wireframe they made previously as a guide. Every
member of the group should contribute to the webpage in some meaningful way.

### Inviting your teamates
In replit you can invite your teamates to the work on the same project as you, just like in google docs
Click on the **+invite** button at the top left of the screen. I suggest you then choose the copy url option
and then send the invite url to your teamates in the zoom breakout room group chat or via slack whichever
is easiest.

### Building your webpages with HTML

Take a look at the html code that's been put into Slack as well as your wireframe.
Use what you've created to help you structure your webpages.

Don't be afraid to look stuff up or reach out for help if you need it.
There's an HTML Cheat Sheet in Canvas which shows some of the most commonly used
HTML elements.

Here's a checklist of things you should consider having in your webpages

- [ ] Title in the <head> tag showing the title of your document
- [ ] h1 element to display the main title text of the webpage
- [ ] h2 element for subtitles
- [ ] An img element showing some type of image for the webpage
- [ ] Some link or a list of links that link to at least one relevant webpage
