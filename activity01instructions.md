## How the  Groups Work
You're in groups of 3-4 for the upcoming activities. If your're in a group of 4 then you'll create a website that
contains  two webpages. As a group you'll come to a concencus on what the website will be about and a general idea
of what content will be present on the pages. As an example, you may decide that your website will be about
a smart phone repair business. You decide that the two webpages will be a home page and then a smart phone info page.
Within the groups of 4, two people will work together on each webpage

## Creating Your Wireframe

Remember that a website wireframe is a "visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website"
Think of it as an outline to your webpage. It provides page structure and layout; styling, color, and graphics
are kept to a minimum.

### What tools to use

In order to complete your wireframe you can use any tool you feel comfortable with
If you're familiar with Paint or Powerpoint or some other display tool you can use that to help you develop the wireframe.
You can also use good old fashioned paper and pencil just to get your ideas on the page, be sure to put your work up to the camera
so that your team can see what you're working on.

### What to focus on

When you make your wireframe be sure to focus on where the content of your webpage will be as well as what content will
be present on your webpage

We've provided a checklist, have one of each on your wireframe
