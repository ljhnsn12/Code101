## Creating Your Wireframe

Remember that a website wireframe is a "visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website"
Think of it as an outline to your webpage. It provides page structure and layout, styling, color, and graphics
are kept to a minimum.

### What to focus on

When you make your wireframe be sure to focus on where the content of your webpage will be, if there will
be images, where content goes, titles and subtitles. If there are links to other pages where are the links?
